0NF	- all information stored in one table
		
1NF	- have a single primary key
	- each entity needs to be unique
	- the table contains atomic values only

2NF	- remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows of a tbale and place them in 
		separate tables with PK>FK relatioanships among the new tables
	- if the tableis in 1NF and every nonkey attribute is dpeendent on the PK
	Actions:
	- 1NF table divided into two tables
	- Table 1 contains only person information. Id is created as the PK for table 1
	- 

3NF	- there must be no dependencies bewteen fields in a singlerow
	- "given a value for column B, do we then have only one possible value for column C?"
	- if so, B and C should be in new table with one of them becoming the PK. A reference to thenew table
		should be left in the original tableand marekd as FK
